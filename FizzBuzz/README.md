Write a program that displays on the screen the numbers from 1 to N, where N is an integer provided by the user. However, for multiples of 3, instead of displaying the number, you should display "Fizz," and for multiples of 5, you should display "Buzz." For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, display "FizzBuzz." The program should print each number or word on a new line.

STEPS:
1-Run npm install
2-Run npm test.
3- ThatÂ´s all
